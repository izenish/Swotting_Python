# Decorators and the @ symbol (@ is just used for the convinience)

'''In general, if func is a decorator function, we decorate
another function my_func using:'''

'''

my_func = func(my_func)

This is so common that python provides a convinient way of writing that:


@func
def my_func(..):
    ...function


is the same as writting


def my_func(...):
    ...function


my_func = func(my_func)

'''Using Reduce
We first need to understand how we are going to calculate the Fibonnaci sequence using reduce:

n=1:
(1, 0) --> (1, 1)

n=2:
(1, 0) --> (1, 1) --> (1 + 1, 1) = (2, 1)  : result = 2 

n=3
(1, 0) --> (1, 1) --> (2, 1) --> (2+1, 2) = (3, 2)  : result = 3

n=4
(1, 0) --> (1, 1) --> (2, 1) --> (3, 2) --> (5, 3)  : result = 5
In general each step in the reduction is as follows:

previous value = (a, b)
new value = (a+b, a)
If we start our reduction with an initial value of (1, 0), we need to run our "loop" n times.

We therefore use a "dummy" sequence of length n to create n steps in our reduce.'''
