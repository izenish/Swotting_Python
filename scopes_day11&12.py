'Global scopes lies within built-in scopes and each of the modules store em in their own namespace'
'builtins have there own namespace and modules have their own namespace'

# for example
# print(a) #this throws an error because it looks for print and a on this module's namespace
# but doesn't find any then it searches on the built-in namespace where print is found but not a hence the error

# print=lambda x:'Hello {0}'.format(x)
# s=print("World")
# print(f"The value of print is first checked in the module and since it finds it here it doesnt look in the built in modile {s}")

# a=10
# def func():
#     print(a)
#     a=100

# func()             # UnboundLocalError: local variable 'a' referenced before assignment
'The above error occurs because while compiling func() a is assigned a value so it is now local but the print statement occurs before the assignment it does not know what it is'


# NonLocal scopes are found in between nested functions

'''Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.
